Hi there, I'm **Milan Milanov**. I'm a humble senior-year **Computer Science** student at Sofia University, currently studying as an Erasmus exchange student in University of Amsterdam.

I'm enthusiastic about programming and problem solving in general. I value (code) **quality** and good **software design/architecture** and am actively trying to learn about them. I [take pride in what I do](http://books.stuartherbert.com/if-i-knew-then/take-pride-in-what-you-do.html){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}.

You can check out some of my open-source activity at [Github](https://github.com/milanov/){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}, professional-related information at [LinkedIn](https://bg.linkedin.com/in/milanmilanov){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}, me trying to be helpful at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4334499/milan-milanov){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'} and to be original at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/milan0v){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}.

My hobbies include [**chess**](http://www.chess.com/members/view/whizz3r){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}, fishing, football (more watching than playing), listening to podcasts and [**good movies**](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur24973204/){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'} and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16736198-milan-milanov){:rel='nofollow' target='_blank'}.
